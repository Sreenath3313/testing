                                Srinivasa Ramanujan Institute of Technology was established by
                                Founder-cum-Secretary Sri Aluru Sambasiva Reddy in November 2007,
                                under the Smt. Aluru Narayanamma Memorial Educational Society, in
                                memory of his mother Late Smt. Aluru Narayanamma — to give shape
                                to his firm belief that "Education is a Key Enabler for Progress."

                                This belief has shaped his entire life — he himself excelled in his
                                scholastic years and then became a tutor, teaching students not
                                only his subject but also imparting higher human values. As his
                                career progressed, he wanted to ensure that maximum students from
                                rural and developing areas could derive benefit from this credo.
